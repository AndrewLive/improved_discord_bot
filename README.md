# improved_discord_bot

A discord bot for me and my friends, rewritten to be cleaner using cogs and modules.
Functions include:

- Text translation using Google Translate's API
- Status retrieval and discord <-> server communication with a locally hosted Minecraft server
- Retrieval of a random 100% real totally-not-made-up quote from Ancient Chinese General, Sun Tzu
- Blackjack played throught discord embeds

## Package dependencies

The modules in used for this bot depend on the following python packages (versions are the ones currently used):

- discord
- dotenv
- googletrans 3.1.0a0 or later
  - must be the specified version to avoid "'None' type has no member 'Group'" error
- mcstatus
- gtts (google text to speech)
- datetime

The following unix applications are also required:
