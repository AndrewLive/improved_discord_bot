To know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.
There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.
Treat your men as you would your own beloved sons. And they will follow you into the deepest valley.
Move swift as the Wind and closely-formed as the Wood. Attack like the Fire and be still as the Mountain.
Opportunities multiply as they are seized.
Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness.
Quickness is the essence of the war.
The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.
Who wishes to fight must first count the cost.
The wise warrior avoids the battle.
What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.
If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.
Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack.
All men can see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.
If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight.
